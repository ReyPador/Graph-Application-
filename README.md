# **RoutePlanner System**  

## **Introduction**  
The **RoutePlanner System** is a Java-based application designed to manage and optimize route planning between locations. This system uses a **graph data structure** to represent locations as **vertices** and roads as **edges**, with weights representing distances. It provides essential functionalities like adding locations, connecting them with roads, and finding the shortest path between two points using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.  

This application simulates a simple navigation system, demonstrating how **graph theory** can be applied to solve real-world problems such as route optimization, logistics, or travel planning.  

## **Features**  
The **RoutePlanner System** offers the following functionalities:  
- **Add Locations**: Allows the addition of new locations to the system.  
- **Add Roads**: Connects locations with roads, specifying distances for each connection.  
- **Display Route Map**: Displays the entire graph, showing all locations and their connections.  
- **Shortest Path Finder**: Determines the shortest path between two locations using BFS, outputting the optimal route.  

## **Why I Made This Application and How It Contributes**  
I developed the **RoutePlanner System** to explore the practical applications of **graph data structures** and **algorithms** in solving real-world problems like route optimization. This project enhanced my understanding of **Java programming**, **graph traversal techniques**, and **efficient data management**. By simulating a navigation system, it provides a useful tool for **students and educators** to learn about graph theory while offering a scalable foundation for further enhancements, such as integrating advanced algorithms or real-world data. It demonstrates how **technology** can simplify **logistics**, **transportation**, and **education**, making processes faster and more efficient, while also serving as a starting point for building more sophisticated route planning or navigation solutions.
